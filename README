This is the official Cordless Repo

Cordless is an open source version of Google Music:isc services for hosting and playing your music. 
It connects to Last.fm and downloads artwork for your tracks, has a nice, themable interface (http://imgur.com/a/ffGRj#2) and only needs a modern browser with Audio support to play.
